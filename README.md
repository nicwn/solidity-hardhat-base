## How to use this to create a new project
1. Pull repo down.
2. Change folder name as needed.
3. Open in VS Code, click "Reopen in Container" when asked.
4. In Terminal, run `npx hardhat init` to create a TypeScript project (with Viem)
5. Test your new project by `npx hardhat compile` and `npx hardhat test`, or try debugging in Mocha's "Testing" tab.

Enjoy.
